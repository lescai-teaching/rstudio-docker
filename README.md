# RStudio Server in Docker

This Docker image is used for teaching purposes.
It has been developed separately for different platforms.
If you own an x86 or AMD64 machine, you should download the **rstudio-docker-amd64** latest version.
If you own a Mac M1 computer, you should download the **rstudio-docker-arm64** latest version.


A massive thank for the ARM64 version goes to @elbamos: I would not have been able to complete it, had it not been for his rstudio-server successfully recompiled.
